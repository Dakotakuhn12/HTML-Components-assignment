              This company is about LeBron James and his success. It was founded
              in December 30th of 2024 because I not only look up to him but so
              do other people in the world. I started this company because it
              was the only way for me to try and share his success with other
              people. This is a certified site because if I ever sold fake
              LeBron stuff ocassionaly I would put it in the caption that it's
              fake and have the price be reasonable. I also made this because
              some sites are not legit and sell fake products but they don't
              tell the customers and they overprice it like crazy to make good
              money off it. They also do it to scam people because some people
              find it fun to do.
